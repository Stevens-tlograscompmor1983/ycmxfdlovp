Oh man, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Phoenician Scheme and like, where do I even start? That plot twist at the end... DID NOT see that coming. You gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and check it out when you get the chance! I swear, my brain's still playing catch-up. It's like they threw a dart at a board of random plot points and were like, Yep, THAT'S the ending! 😆

So, anyway, the main character—can we just talk about how he basically stumbled his way through the whole scheme? Like, bro seemed more surprised than anyone that he ended up saving the day. And that sidekick? Legit couldn't tell if he was supposed to be comic relief or just accidentally hilarious. But seriously, how long was that car chase? I felt like it went on for ages and I'm just sitting there, like, Can we wrap this up already? It's like the director was getting paid by the minute or something.

> Anyway, the soundtrack though. So dope. Seriously, whoever picked those tracks really knew what they were doing. That one song in the club scene? It's been stuck in my head since I hit play—gotta find out what it was. I think 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   just for the music would even be worth it, no cap.

And the special effects? Bruh, some parts looked like they spent the entire budget, then other scenes were like, Did you guys 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 some 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 trial CGI software or something? Like, c'mon, a bit more consistency would've been nice. But I guess it adds to that quirky charm? Maybe I'm just tired and rambling, lol.

var randomJavaScript = true; // I dunno why I just put this here, haha.

Anyway, I'd totally 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again to catch all those little details I probably missed. Hit me up when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it – gotta hear your thoughts. 😄urerhwerla.
